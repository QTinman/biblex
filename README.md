Bible Lexicon is designed to work with greek and hebrew lexicons. 
This small program uses word to calculate three ciphers and look the numbers up in two lexicons.

The two lexicons can be DL from https://biblehub.com/str/ as two .zip files and unpacked to your drive.

On first run of the program these two lexicons need to be selected.
